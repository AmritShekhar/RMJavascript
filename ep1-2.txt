Everything in Javascript happens inside the Execution Context.

Execution Context
1. Memory Component / Variable Environment
    Memory Component contains variables and functions as the key value pairs.
2. Code Component / Thread of Execution
    Code Component is the place where whole Javascript code is executed.

Javascript is a synchronous single threaded language.
1. Single Threaded: Javascript can execute only one command at a time.
2. Synchronous: Synchronous means in a specific order i.e it can only go to the next line for execution only after 
   the current line is executed.

Execution Context is created in two phases:
1. Memory Creation Phase 
   In this phase, Javascript will allocate memory to all the variables and functions.
2. Code Execution Phase
   In this phase, Javascript runs through the whole code and executes it line by line.


/*

   Call stack maintains the order of execution of the Execution Contexts.
